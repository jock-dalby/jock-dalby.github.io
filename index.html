      <h3>A little about me....</h3>
      
      <p>Hi everyone! My name's Jock, I live in Wellington, NZ and I am training to become a web developer.</p>

      <p>My background is 12 years managing pubs, bars and restaurants across the UK, Australia and New Zealand. In May 2015, I left the hospitality industry in search of a new challenge, and a better quality of life.</p> 

      <p>Soon after, myself and two fellow co-founders headed down to Christchurch to take part in <a href="https://www.lightninglab.co.nz/christchurch/">Lightning Lab, 2015</a>, NZâ€™s premiere business accelerator programme. Over the 12-weeks at LL,CHCH we founded the company <a href="https://www.MightyGem.com">MightyGem.com</a>, a customer feedback, loyalty and rewards system for cafes, bars and restaurants.

      <p>Lightning Lab gave me my first insight into the web industry and it was here I discovered my passion for technology, innovation and entrepreneurship. Since leaving the lab I have been studying hard to increase my knowledge &amp; understanding, and have completed several courses on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> and <a href="https://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> to further develop my technical skills.</p>

      <p>I am now ready to accelerate my learning, and to kickstart my new career in web development. What hospitality and Lightning Lab have both taight me is how to deal with intensive, high-pressure environments involve long hours and creative thinking. This is the environment in which I thrive, and what gets me really excited about the Dev Academy experience.</p>

      <p>Over the coming 18 weeks I will recording my experiences through a series of (fairly) regular blogs. If anyone has any questions, insights or feedback, it would be great to hear from you.</p>

      <p>Otherwise, bon voyage and wish me luck......</p>
