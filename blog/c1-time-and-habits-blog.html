      <h4>Managing Time &amp; Creating Habits</h4>

      <p>
        Our first assignment at <a href="http://www.devacademy.co.nz/">Dev Academy</a> requires us to spend some time researching and exploring 'time and habit management techniques', and report back on our findings. Specific topics include meditation &amp; mindfulness, the power of habit, and timeboxing &amp; the pomodoro technique.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/how-meditation-affects-your-brain">Meditation</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.productivityninja.co.uk/getting-things-done-and-the-mindful-productivity-ninja/">Mindfulness</a> are topics I previously knew very little about and to be honest, wasn't particularly interested in learning. But after reading a few of the articles, it actually makes quite alot of sense and is something I am definately going to try to incorporate into my daily routine. By default, I am an active relaxer and often find it difficult to switch off. Some of these meditation techniques only take a few minutes and could be the answer I have been looking for to help me unwind after a long day.

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voX0gUn_JOI">The Power of Habit</a> on the other hand is something I can immediately relate to, and is the kind of technique I already use. If I am looking to make a change to my lifestyle or a system at work, I set up alarms and put reminders up everywhere, and then after a while, it just becomes second nature. During Dev Academy I am going to make a strong effort to do more of this, and to implement a few more good habits (and possibly try and shake off a few of the old, not-so-good ones).
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/timebox/">timeboxing</a> is a concept that is completely foreign to me, and probably the one I could benefit from using the most. Generally, I am the type of person who does something until the job is done. In my previous employment this work ethic has often resulted in me working 80+hrs/ week for 50hrs pay. As a web developer, timeboxing makes an awful lot of sense, as I could easily lose hours (if not days) lost down a rabbit hole. I am going to try to focus on improving my timeboxing skills, and implementing the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">pomodoro technique</a> as often as possible.
