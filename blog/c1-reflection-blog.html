  <h2>First impressions of Dev Academy, Wellington</h2>
  <h3>Hey there, thanks for tuning in.......</h3>

  <p>So, here we are: <a href="https://www.devacademy.co.nz">Dev Academy</a> Wellington, phase-0, Day Two!<br>Yesterday, the cohort got together and enjoyed a brief orientation session, where everyone had a chance to introduce themselves and share their own individual answer to the golden question; Why Dev Academy and why now? In the evening, the week 1 assignment pack was uploaded to <a href="https://www.waffle.io">Waffle</a>, including a section on EDAs teaching style and cutlure.</p>

  <p>As you may know, EDA is an immersive 18 week program which teaches students the technical skills required to become a web developer. They also put huge emphasis on developing communication and interpersonal skills through a subject they call 'Empathy Engineering'. Web development and innovation are both <b>TEAM</b> sports in which collaboration and teamwork are the keys to success.</p>

  <p>This is what really gets me going about Dev Academy. I have spent the past few months cooped up at home, completing online courses on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> and <a href="https://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> and am extremley excited about being part of an ambitious team and putting some of the skills I have learned into action.</p> 

  <p>My background is managing pubs, bars and restaurants, but I left the hospitality industry early last year to pursue the life of an entrepreneur. Almost immediately, I found myself heading down to Christchurch after enrolling in <a href="https://www.lightninglab.co.nz/christchurch/">Lightning Lab</a>, a 12 week business accelerator program.<br>Three months at Lightning Lab gave me a real insight into the web industry and I instantly wanted to learn as much as possible and further develop my technical skills and understanding. What hospitality and Lightning Lab both have in common, is they are both high-pressure, intensive <i>working/learning</i> environments that involve long hours and creative thinking. This is also the type of environment I expect at Dev Academy and what attracted me to the programme.</p>

  <p>My initial impressions of EDA is it is an exciting, hands-on and innovative approach to teaching. It puts onus on the student to manage their own projects and accelerate their own learning potential. The team at EDA are ready to offer guidance and support, and to teach the soft skills required to be a great team player in the real world.</p>

  <p>I look forward to the next few months and will try to blog regularly with a progress report and an insight into the going ons at EDev Academy. Thanks for listening, until next time....</p>
