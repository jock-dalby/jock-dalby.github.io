      <h4>First impressions of Dev Academy, Wellington</h4>

      <p>Hey there, thanks for tuning in.......</p>

      <p>So, here we are, week one of <a href="http://www.devacademy.co.nz/">Dev Academy</a>, Wellington. Earlier this week, the cohort got together online and enjoyed a brief orientation session, where everyone had a chance to introduce themselves and share their own individual answer to the golden question; Why Dev Academy and why now?</p>

      <p>As you may know, EDA is an immersive 18 week program which teaches students the technical skills required to become a web developer. What you may not know is Dev Academy also put huge emphasis on developing students' communication and interpersonal skills, through a subject they call 'Empathy Engineering'. This is to prepare students for the real world of web development and innovation, which are largegly <b>TEAM</b> sports that rely on effective collaboration, interaction and strong teamwork in order to be successful.</p>

      <p>I am throuroughly excited about the next few months at Dev Academy, and feel both their culture and their teaching style are well suited to my background and personality. I have been cooped up at home for the past few months, completing online courses on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> and <a href="https://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>, and am thrilled to now be part of an ambitious and motivated team, and finally have the chance to put some of the technical skills I have learned into action.</p> 

      <p>My initial impressions of EDA is they offer an exciting, hands-on and innovative approach to teaching; they put onus on the student to manage their own projects and accelerate their own learning potential. The team at EDA are there to offer guidance and support, and to teach students the soft skills required to be a great team player in the real world.</p>

      <p> It is my intention to write a (fairly) regular blog with updates, progress reports and insights into life at Dev Academy. As I think we are in for a steep ride, I am making no promises, but please do be sure to watch this space just in case!</p>

      <p>Cheers,</p>
