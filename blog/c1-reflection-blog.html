<h1>First impressions of Dev Academy, Wellington</h1>
<h2>Hey there, thanks for tuning in.......</h2>

<p>So, here we are on Day-2 of phase-0 at Enspiral Dev Academy, Wellington.<br>Yesterday we had a brief orientation session via zoom, where I had chance to meet one of the tutors and a few of my fellow cohortee's and then in the evening our first weeks information and assignments were delivered. Included in said assignements was a section outlining the culture at EDA and felt this would be a great topic on which to begin my blog.</p>

<p>Overall I am feeling excited, optimistic and inspired by the whole EDA experience. I have spent the past few months completing online courses on <a href="www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> and <a href="www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> and am really looking forward to putting the skills I have learned into action.</p> 

<p>My background is managing pubs, bars and restaurants, but left the industry early last year to pursue a life of entrepreneurship. Almost immediately, I found myself along with two other co-founders heading down to Christchurch to attend the 12 week business accelerator, <a href="www.lightninglab.co.nz/christchurch/">Lightning Lab</a>.<br>Both hospitality and accelerator programs are high-pressure, intensive <i>working</i> and <i>learning</i> environments, that involve long hours and require you to think on your feet; this is what I love about the EDA program as opposed to say a degree etc.; it's quick, it's fast and it delivers results. Also, at LL,CHCH I learned a great deal about tech, innovation and web development; all three of which I have discovered a great passion for.</p>

<p>What are your impressions?</p>
<p>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</p>
<p>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</p>
<p>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</p>
