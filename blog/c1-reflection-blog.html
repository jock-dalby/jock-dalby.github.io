<h2>First impressions of Dev Academy, Wellington</h2>
<h3>Hey there, thanks for tuning in.......</h3>

<p>So, here we are on Day-2 of phase-0 at <a href="https://www.devacademy.co.nz">EDA</a>, Wellington.<br>Yesterday, the cohort got together and enjoyed a brief orientation session via zoom, where everyone had a chance to introduce themselves and share with everyone the answer to the golden question; 'so,why Dev Academy?'.<br>In the evening we recieved our week 1 assignment pack, which included a section on the background, culture and teaching style of Enspiral Dev Academy.</p>

<p>As you may know, EDA is an immersive 18 week program which teaches students the technical skills required to become a web developer, but web dev is almost the secondary subject EDA teaches. They also put huge emphasis on the developing communication and interpersonal skills through a subject they call 'Empathy Engineering'. Web development and innovation are both <b>TEAM</b> sports; collaboration and teamwork are the key to success.</p>

<p>This is what really excites me about my forthcoming EDA experience. I have spent the past few months cooped up at home, completing online courses on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> and <a href="https://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> and looking forward to being part of a team and putting some of the skills I have learned into action.</p> 

<p>My background is managing pubs, bars and restaurants, but I left the hospitality industry early last year to pursue a life of entrepreneurship. Almost immediately, I found myself heading down to Christchurch after enrolling in <a href="https://www.lightninglab.co.nz/christchurch/">Lightning Lab</a>, a 12 week business accelerator program.<br>Three months at Lightning Lab gave me a real insight into the tech space and I instantly wanted to learn as much as possible to further develop my skills and understanding. What hospitality and Lightning Lab have in common is they are both high-pressure, intensive <i>working/learning</i> environments that involve long hours and creative thinking. This is what is required to succeed in the EDA style of learning and what attracted me to this particluar course.</p>

<p>My initial impressions of EDA is it is an exciting, hands-on and innovative approach to teaching web development. It puts onus on the student to manage their own projects and accelerate their own learning potential. The team at EDA are there to offer guidance and support as required, and to teach the soft skills needed to be a great team player in the real world.</p>

<p>I look forward to the next few months and will try to blog regularly with a progress report and an insight into the going ons at EDA, Wellington. Thanks for listening. Until next time....</p>
